        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Pour 12 oz chocolate chips into microwave safe bowl, microwave
                for about 2 minutes, taking bowl out every 45 seconds to stir.
                Continue to cook and stir until chocolate chips are melted and
                silky. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or reusable baking
                mats and pour 1 cup of crushed peppermint candy into shallow
                bowl.
                Dip each Oreo cookie halfway into chocolate, then place on
                baking pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once all cookies are on the baking sheets, sprinkle peppermint
                candies liberally over cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                Refrigerate until chocolate hardens, at least 15 minutes. Once
                hardened, you can distribute them into plastic bags or jars as
                gifts. Or refrigerate until you eat them.
